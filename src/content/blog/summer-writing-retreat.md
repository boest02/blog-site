**Summer Writing Retreat Challenge — Begins June 20th!**

Starting on June 20th, the first official day of summer, I’m launching the **Summer Writing Retreat Challenge—** a celebration of writing as an act of self-care, creativity, and joyful indulgence.

This “retreat” isn’t about going away— it's about going inward. It’s a personal commitment to carve out time for writing this summer, not out of pressure, but for pleasure. This challenge is an invitation to rediscover writing as a hobby, reignite it as a career, all while reconnecting with your inner child. 

Join me in keeping writing fun this summer by following along with my [summer bingo card](/summer-bingo.png).

**What Inspired the Summer Writing Retreat?** 

When I was a little girl,  I would write a Summer Bucket List every year at the start of summer— filled with little dreams that I could check-off along the way. From dancing in the raining to making daisy chains, each item represented a season of endless possibilities.

Somewhere in my twenties, life got busy with a career and trying to figure out my place in this world, and I stopped making those lists. 

This summer, I’m bringing it back!

Only now, it’s a little different:
  1. It’s a **bingo card**—because life gets busy, and crossing off every square isn’t the point.
  2. It’s **writing-focused**—because this year I’m prioritizing writing as a passion and joy of mine.
  3. It’s **shared with you**—because the best journeys are the ones we don’t take alone.

So here’s to a summer of stories, childlike wonder, and spontaneous adventure. I’ll be checking off squares and celebrating every win—big or small—and I hope you’ll join me along the way!
